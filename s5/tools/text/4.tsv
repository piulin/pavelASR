0.00	10.19	in this video i will show how to finalize the data structure how to finalize the directory structure for the recipy
11.97	20.67	first of all we need to attach all shared tools from kaldi to our recipy
22.67	37.06	eh the tutorial tells us to copy the tools from wall street journal but we will just create eh symbolic links
38.12	43.56	the scripts from kaldi are stored in two directories utils and steps
47.05	50.18	let's connect to phoenix server
50.19	53.62	change the directory
57.16	59.80	and go our recipy
63.78	74.57	and let's take a look for example to let's take a look at another recipy
77.04	88.58	it is called mini librispeech and it is actually the go to recipy for all beginners
88.59	97.60	it is a model recipy this is recipy which servers as a model for all new recipies
101.82	113.53	here we can see this symlink utils which points to wall street journal utils and steps which points to wall street journal steps
114.09	130.36	for historical reasons all common or shared kaldi scripts are kept in wall street journal recipy and all other recipies just link to this directories
130.76	133.76	we will do the same in our recipy
146.90	150.65	now we can access utils from our recipy
151.00	162.16	and the first thing which that we will do will be validation of our data from previous step
164.21	173.36	it is quite important to run this script and another one fix data directory
173.49	183.48	on the data after you think that you finished the preparation and data is ready to be used
183.97	205.67	quite often it happens that many mistakes in data preparation are not visible until some kaldi script executes validation or fixes it
205.68	219.06	and when it happens accidentally or suddenly usually you are not around to see this
219.07	232.89	and it takes time to find out what actually happened so it's good idea to run these scripts right away to see if everything is good with the data
235.22	243.41	aha okay so the first complaint is that we don't need don't have speaker to utterance mapping
246.21	260.39	we can actually apply fix data dir and when it sees that this file is missing it generates it because it's possible to generate it from utterance to speaker mapping
261.54	268.96	it is just inverse of speaker to utterance
268.97	287.43	we can see that it also sorts it in proper way checks that all files that list attributes of utterances actually list some common utterances
287.46	303.09	and removes utterances which are not mentioned in some of the files in this case there were no such utterances and all one thousand five hundred utterances were saves or or kept
303.10	305.08	now we can validate again
307.46	312.09	now we see that it can not find features file
313.79	325.23	and it's actually normal for the moment because we have not yet run the feature extraction we can specify this option
327.54	343.93	now it tells us that data directories successfully validated and it means that most likely we will be able to use these data directory in our recipy and all the following scripts and that there will be no problem
346.15	351.62	we can do the same for the test
353.41	356.54	five hundred utterances are kept
364.44	372.82	and it's validated successfully but with one warning that we only have one speaker
372.83	386.31	but we know that's alright because it was our intention to use very small dataset and to use three speakers for training and one separate speaker for testing
391.72	407.48	okay another thing is that this tutorial mentions voxforge many times as a model recipy but it's already out of date and current recommended recipy is mini librispeech as i mentioned
410.60	418.75	next thing that we need to copy is a scoring script and we will copy it from mini librispeech again
434.39	437.83	we also need to create a local directory
437.84	454.25	local directory usually contains scripts which are specific for this recipy and not shared between many recipies as opposite to scripts in utils and steps directories
465.81	470.83	next step is language model toolkit installation
473.11	478.60	we need to go to kaldi tools and check this script
491.15	494.31	let's read the comments inside
503.03	508.51	so we need to be in tools directory
510.21	514.88	this is true we are there
515.44	520.02	and we also need to have the source code for this toolkit
521.06	533.28	it can not be installed automatically and normally you would need to go to this website fill out some form and download it and save it here
533.65	544.73	but at ims we already downloaded this archive and we can copy it
568.78	571.04	let's try to run it
686.79	691.67	alright it looks like it finished successfully
692.39	696.93	let's proceed further
700.35	705.55	now we need to create two configuration files
706.34	718.74	the first one is decode config it's used for the script which runs decoding obviously
719.35	723.24	but first we need to go back to the recipy
730.35	733.29	and create conf directory
735.96	745.63	we will actually just copy the configs from the mini librispeech recipe again
761.31	767.00	as you can see there is nothing to read in it
767.53	770.89	and i think it's okay
772.23	776.75	and another one is mfcc extraction config
791.18	794.69	this one actually contains one option
804.89	807.39	see you in the next video
