0.00	3.10	hi everyone my name is pavel
3.11	6.08	i will get you familiar with kaldi toolkit in this module
6.98	11.87	to start please go to the official website of kaldi kaldi dash asr dot org
11.88	15.85	on the website please click documentation link
18.07	24.79	kaldi is a toolkit for speech recognition research and it is intended for speech recognition researchers and professionals
24.80	32.22	recently it is getting slightly less relevant for the research however it is still very popular in the industry
32.28	39.15	if you would join a company and would work on speech recognition there most likely you would need to use kaldi
40.83	46.72	in the next videos i will walk you through kaldi for dummies tutorial
50.04	61.06	after brief introduction the tutorial lists environment requirements for installation and usage of kaldi
62.14	72.77	we will use ims server to install and use kaldi therefore we should not worry about the requirements everything should be ready there
72.78	77.55	to connect to the server we will use terminal application and ssh command
80.11	86.02	please type ssh your ims login
86.03	93.49	then the name of the server it's phoenix ims uni stuttgart
100.57	108.91	on the web server you should change your directory to teamlab project directory
120.08	126.30	don't type exactly the same what i typed it's my directory you should use your own
130.61	132.11	alright
132.12	134.00	now we need to download kaldi
142.25	147.84	kaldi is open source and it is hosted on github
147.85	154.10	we just need to run git clone to get a copy of the whole kaldi source code
224.41	227.54	okay git clone finished
228.65	235.92	now we have kaldi directory and we go there
237.94	245.41	you can see the files of the top level of kaldi
246.63	250.17	now we can go to the installation step
251.67	255.43	the top are like eh
255.79	259.74	the top level instructions are located in the install file
259.82	261.02	let's check it
264.37	273.53	it tells us to go to tools follow install instructions there then go to src and follow install instructions there
274.88	279.23	let's go to tools
279.96	290.47	it is a directory contains scripts to install additional third party tools needed for kaldi or for kaldi recipies
290.97	292.22	we will talk about them later
306.34	313.46	so first thing that we need to do is to run this script to check the dependencies
319.69	324.25	it gives a couple of warnings we can ignore them
346.07	355.21	now we can run make it will install necessary tools it will involve compilation
355.22	362.53	at ims we have eh compiler cache by default it's called ccache
364.38	380.40	and it would be better to disable it because in kaldi we will compile a lot of files and we will quickly run out of disk space for cache
392.69	400.08	we will disable the compile cache by exporting variable
400.97	403.16	ccache disable equals one
403.81	408.78	now we can run make to compile the tools
409.66	419.30	and we will use j option which tells make to run several compilation jobs in parallel
420.28	426.62	it is needed for faster installation and faster processing
426.89	440.27	since we have since we have forty cpu cores on this server we can run make with forty jobs
471.46	476.70	okay as we see everything went well
477.89	480.55	tools installation completed
480.56	483.47	now let's go to src
483.48	485.74	src stands for source code
485.99	488.85	this is the actual code of kaldi
491.86	495.38	let's see the installation instructions
497.01	504.46	the installation instructions are configure script
515.64	525.58	okay libraries are not found but at ims we have alternative library called atlas we can use it
540.66	545.01	now we see a problem with cuda libraries
545.02	553.17	we actually should disable cuda because it's only needed to train neural networks so far it's not needed
555.76	560.72	to see how to do it we will call configure script with help option
564.61	568.28	build with cuda default yes
568.46	572.69	we will change this option to no
587.19	597.74	kaldi has been successfully configured now we can compile kaldi using these two make commands
601.31	607.60	and we specify again forty parallel jobs for the compilation
638.18	641.05	okay it says done
641.06	643.95	it means everything went well again
643.96	648.87	we have successfully downloaded and compiled kaldi
648.88	651.77	now it's ready for use
651.86	659.83	and we can go to the next part of kaldi tutorial kaldi directories structure
659.84	662.30	see you in the next video
