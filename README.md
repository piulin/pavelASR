# Improving a Domain Specific English ASR System for a Russian Native Speaker with Kaldi 

Automatic speech recognition plays an essential role in human-
machine interaction (HMI). In this globalized era, users may
choose to use non-native languages for HMI when systems do
not support them or to access the benefits of well-resourced lan-
guages, e.g. English. This work explores a number of modifi-
cations to adapt an ASR system for English of Russian native
speakers. Models are built using the open-source Kaldi toolkit,
and their results are compared to a baseline constructed using
the mini librispeech corpus. Our best speech recognizer
is able to outperform our baseline system by about 46 percent-
age points.
